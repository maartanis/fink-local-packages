Description: CIF/STAR file support for Python
DescDetail: <<
PyCIFRW provides support for reading and writing CIF (Crystallographic
Information Format) files using Python.  It was developed at the Australian
National Beamline Facility (ANBF), run by the Australian Synchrotron
Research Program (ASRP), as part of a larger project to provide CIF
input/output capabilities for data collection.  It is now (Feb 2018)
maintained and developed within the Australian Nuclear Science and
Technology Organisation (ANSTO).
