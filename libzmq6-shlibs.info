DescDetail: <<
MQ (ZeroMQ, 0MQ, zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but
acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry
whole messages across various transports like in-process,
inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with
patterns like fanout, pub-sub, task distribution, and
request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered
products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore
applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a
score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems.
