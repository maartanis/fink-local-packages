Description: N-dimensional array package for Python
DescDetail: <<
NumPy (formerly known as scipy_core) is the fundamental package needed
for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

  - a powerful N-dimensional array object
  - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
  - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
  - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an
efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary
data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and
speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
<<
DescPackaging:  <<
Note that bogus failures occur in the 1.9.x testsuite for extensions due to -shared not
being passed during linkage. Upstream doesn't understand why this happens on darwin.

https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5229
Seems to be fixed in 1.10 (at least for Yosemite and El Capitan).
Impossible to issue a warning for the potential failures as a 'sys.exit(1)'
causes the install phase to immediately exit (thanks to 'bash -e'?).

Set SHELL (%v >= 1.13.0) because fink-bld's shell is /usr/bin/false and several configure test programs require a real shell.
