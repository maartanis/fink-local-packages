DescDetail: <<
  ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total
  energy, charge density and electronic structure of systems made of
  electrons and nuclei (molecules and periodic solids) within Density
  Functional Theory (DFT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave or
  wavelet basis.  ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry
  according to the DFT forces and stresses, or to perform molecular
  dynamics simulations using these forces, or to generate dynamical
  matrices, Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors, based on
  Density-Functional Perturbation Theory, and many more properties.
  Excited states can be computed within the Many-Body Perturbation Theory
  (the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation), and
  Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (for molecules).  In addition to
  the main ABINIT code, different utility programs are provided.  ABINIT is
  a project that favours development and collaboration.
