DescDetail: <<
Numdiff is a program with the capability to "appropriately" compare files
containing numerical fields.  When you compare a couple of such files, what
you want to obtain usually is a list of the numerical fields in the second
file which numerically differ from the corresponding fields in the first
file.  Tools like `diff', `cmp' or `wdiff' can not be used to this purpose:
they can not recognize whether a difference between two numeric fields is
only due to the notation or is actually a difference of numerical values.
Moreover, you could also want to ignore differences in numerical values as
long as they do not overcome a certain threshold.  In other words, you
could desire to neglect all "small" numerical differences too.  However,
programs like `diff' and `wdiff' can not be used to ignore "small"
numerical differences, since they do not even know what a numerical
difference is.  That is why I decided to implement Numdiff.
